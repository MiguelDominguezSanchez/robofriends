Welcome back everyone

I have some good news
and some bad news

Lets start off with the bad news
is that in ES2021
which is the latest version of javascript

Lets start off with the bad news
the bad news is that in ES2021
the latest version of javascript
the changes to the language
the aren't that many
exciting new features
you can google ES2021 features
and a lot of them
are features 
that you wont encounter 
in your day to day

Now the good news
is that 
you dont have to a whole lot of new features
as a matter of fact
there is one important one 
that I am gonna show you
but thats it
nice and easy
nice quick video

so lets see how quickly we can do this
lets say I have a string lets call it str
so lets make that into a string
ztm is te best of the best

const str = 'ztm is the best of the best'

we are a little bit biased
but lets go along with it
with a new feature in ES2021

we have something that we  have in all strings
a method that we can use in all strings
if I do string dot replaceAll

str.replaceAll

what it does
it allows me to replace
something inside the string 
so lets say I want to change 'best'
inside the string
and I say 'best' and 'worst'
so if I replace that string
like that

str.replaceAll('best', 'worst')

//

const str = 'ztm is the best of the best'
str.replaceAll('best', 'worst') // 'ztm is the worst of the worst'
//

'ztm is the worst of the worst'

//

oh that is a little bit rude 
but thats what we got
if I do string here

//

str // 'ztm is the best of the best'

//

and that is because 
we didn't really assign 
this to anything
the original sting remains
but the new string
so I could have done
do something like this
and I can assign it
I do const b equals this

const b = str.replaceAll('best', 'worst')

and now b is ztm is the worst of the worst

b // 'ztm is the worst of the worst'

I definitely dont like this one 
i like the other one

thats it ES2021
that is all it really does
all we really
I mean its pretty nice to have
a fun little side fact
javascript used to have something called

.replace()

so we could have done:

//

const str = 'ztm is the best of the best'
str.replaceAll('best', 'worst')

const c = str.replace('best', 'worst')

//

but this one the problem with this one
is that it only change the first instance of the word
so we see here :

c //  'ztm is the worst of the best'

is that you dont need to learn a new bunch of new features
a little bit better but definitely not the best of the best

So anyway a fun little fact
fun little tip bid
ES2021 wwe have this replaceAll
ok I manage to make this video
way to long for what it really is
pretty easy right?

go grab a coffee and I see you in  the next one
bye bye
