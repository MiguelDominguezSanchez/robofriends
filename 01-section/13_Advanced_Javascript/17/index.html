      // in this case in the window object
      // well I can never use 'a' again
      // and maybe a hundred of line
      // by mistake I assign a variable 'a'  
      // and I rise my a function
      // well thats a huge problem
      // and thats a big problem in general
      // you wanna make sure 
      // that you don't pollute
      // the 'Global Namespace'
      // that is the window object
      // with all these names
      // because then you have collisions
      // you have different team members
      // working on different pieces of code
      // and all of a sudden 
      // we go out with the same name
      // its a big problem
      alert('a')

    /*
    the next attempt was script tags
    and this iis something that we are familiar with
    instead of having inline
    we have script tags
    and we already play around 
    with bootstrap and jQuery
    this is what we did
    we had our jQuery file
    that loads first
    then our javascript file loads second
    and as you can see 
    we have one javascript file
    then the second one,
    then the third,
    then the fourth one,
    this way you have
    everything outside of the html
    so iit solved the problem

    Well the problem with script tag
    as far as I can see 
    are three things

    if we need to add another page
    and an about page
    we still have to copy and paste
    these script tags
    and again we don't really wanna do that

    The second one is the lack of
    'Dependency Resolution'
    and that means that you are responsible 
    to make sure that the scripts are added in the proper
    for example if this script '1.js'
    accesses a function for
    the number '4.js'
    well
    its gonna fail
    because the number '4.js' file
    hasn't load yet
    so thats lack of dependency resolution

    and finally the third
    this doesn't really solve
    the global nanmespace problem
    its polluting the global namespace
    all the functions and variables
    that are declared in each of this files
    will be on the window object

    ok what about the third attempt

    IIFE

    Immediately Invoked Function Expression
    I know thats a mouth full
    but it looks something like this

    go to the javascript fil in this folder

    /.../
