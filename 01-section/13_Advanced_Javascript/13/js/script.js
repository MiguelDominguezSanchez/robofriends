Hello
welcome back to the latest feature
of ECMAScript
they keep adding new things,
but this is new
a really good one,
so the latest ES2020
has some really new features
and I gonna show you some of my favorite ones
you can see them right here

BigInt

Optional Chaining Operator ?.
Promise.allSettled
globalThis

Now iin this video we are gonna talk about these three

BigInt
Nullish Coalescing Operator ??
Optional Chaining Operator ?.

and later on we will have separate lectures for ES2020

Promise.allSettled
and also
globalThis

those lectures will be title
ES2020 with the respective names

are better understood
once we go over a few different new topics

So lets just focus on
these three for now

BigInt
Nullish Coalescing Operator ??
Optional Chaining operator ?.

Lets say we wanna find out in  our console over here
if I do:
typeof
it gives me the type of something
if I do:

typeof 4 // 'number'

its a number
if I do:
